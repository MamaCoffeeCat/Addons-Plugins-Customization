I've been very annoyed with trying to find a Streamdeck Mini screensaver template so I made one.
.psd file is set for max compatability so if there's something broken, please check your version before commenting. 
When commenting please dont scream at me, im just a cat on the internet and will cry. 

Guides are set to align with the middle of the boxes on your SD-Mini. Use the blank groups to parse out your project and just add to it as you go.
There are multipule groups so you can quickly make multipule screenshots in the same project file, save, and alter them as you go. 
Please let me know if there's something you'd like to change. 

If you're here from Reddit, don't comment in two places. I will get your message eventually and get back to you, just as with my tickets.
Multi comments will be ignored deprioritized/ignored.
